## 🔑 Critical Business Logic

**Compactor Optimization**:
```
IF avg_tons_per_haul < 7.0 
   AND max_days_between < 14
THEN recommend monitors
SAVINGS = (current_hauls - target_hauls) × cost_per_haul - monitoring_cost
```

**Contamination**:
```
IF contamination_charges > 3% of total_spend
THEN recommend reduction program
```

**Bulk Subscription**:
```
IF avg_monthly_bulk > $500
THEN recommend subscription
```
