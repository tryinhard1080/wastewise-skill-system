WasteWise Complete Suite is a comprehensive waste analysis platform branded as "WasteWise by THE Trash Hub" (never mention Advantage Waste in deliverables). Delivers Excel workbook (9 tabs) and HTML dashboard (6 tabs) with executive summary.

Excel workbook structure (9 tabs): 
1. SUMMARY_FULL - Starts with "Potential to Reduce 2026 Trash Expense by $X,XXX"
2. EXPENSE_ANALYSIS - Row-based format where each invoice appears as separate row with columns: Month | Vendor | Service Type | Invoice Number | Amount | Cost/Door | Notes. Includes monthly subtotals with budget per door and grand total with average monthly budget
3. HAUL_LOG - Compactor pickup details (only created if compactor detected)
4. OPTIMIZATION - Three opportunities with full calculation breakdowns
5. CONTRACT_TERMS - Risk analysis with calendar reminders (only created if contract provided)
6. REGULATORY_COMPLIANCE - Orlando-style format with professional tables, color-coded status indicators (VERIFY=orange, RECOMMENDED=blue), priority levels (HIGH=red, MEDIUM=orange, LOW=green). Sections include: Overview, Mandatory Requirements, Compliance Checklist, Licensed Haulers, Penalties, Sources. Requires minimum 3-5 licensed haulers with confidence scoring (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
7. LEASE-UP_NOTES - Lease-up phase assessment (only created when property generates >40% below benchmark indicating not at stabilized occupancy)
8. DOCUMENTATION_NOTES - Vendor contacts extracted from invoices and calculation formulas
9. QUALITY_CHECK - Validation summary showing results of 40+ pre-output checks

Critical optimization thresholds:
- Compactor monitors: Recommend only if average <7 tons/haul AND max interval between pickups ≤14 days
- Contamination reduction: Recommend only if contamination charges >3% of total spend
- Bulk trash subscription: Recommend only if average bulk charges >$500/month
- Lease-up detection: Properties >40% below benchmark (prevents false optimization recommendations)

Property type benchmarks (yards per door per month):
- Garden-style: 2.0-2.5 yards/door
- Mid-rise: 1.8-2.3 yards/door  
- High-rise: 1.5-2.0 yards/door
- Compactor target: 8-9 tons per haul

Key contacts for recommendations:
- Report Author: Richard Bates, THE Trash Hub, Director
- Compactor Monitors: Keith Conrad, DSQ Technologies, keith.conrad@dsqtech.com (compactor monitor installation and optimization)
- Bulk Trash Services: Cole Myers, Ally Waste, cole@allywaste.com (supplemental bulk trash removal)

Quality standards enforcement:
- Every invoice number must be visible in EXPENSE_ANALYSIS for audit trail
- Monthly cost per door must be prominently displayed in subtotal rows
- Regulatory research confidence must be assessed and displayed (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Validation must pass all checks before workbook generation
- Lease-up phase properties must be identified with LEASE-UP_NOTES tab explaining why optimization isn't recommended
- QUALITY_CHECK tab shows transparent validation results

Key principles:
- Dumpster benchmarks are for comparison ONLY (never recommend service changes for dumpster properties)
- Compactor optimization represents ACTIONABLE opportunities (increase tons/haul, reduce pickup frequency)
- Remove ALL Energy Star references from analysis outputs
- Lease-up properties require different evaluation criteria (low waste generation is expected and normal)
- Cost per yard: Show metric but be cautious with comparisons unless strong regional data available
- Branding: Always "WasteWise by THE Trash Hub" for external deliverables, never cross-reference Advantage Waste

Project files location:
- Main skill: /mnt/project/SKILL__2_UPDATED.md (3,064 lines, updated November 2025)
- Template: /mnt/project/wastewise_expense_format_template_UPDATED.md (row-based format standard)

Recent updates (November 2025):
- Workbook expanded from 8 to 9 tabs
- EXPENSE_ANALYSIS converted from column-based to row-based format
- REGULATORY_COMPLIANCE converted to Orlando-style table format
- Added three new tabs: LEASE-UP_NOTES (conditional), DOCUMENTATION_NOTES (always), QUALITY_CHECK (always)
- Updated compactor threshold from 5-6 tons to <7 tons per haul
- Enhanced validation framework with 40+ automated checks

Communication preferences: Precise, data-driven, professional tone. Avoid excessive preamble or postamble in deliverables.
