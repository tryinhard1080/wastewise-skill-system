# WasteWise Build - Your Action Plan

## What to Do Next

**Created**: November 14, 2025

2. Mobile responsive
3. Error handling
4. Launch!

**Cost**: $160-700/month in services, your time
**Timeline**: 8 weeks
**Result**: Full ownership, learned a lot

---

### Path B: Hire Developer ($10-15K)

**Week 1**: Find developer

- Post on Upwork/Toptal
- "React + Supabase expert for waste management SaaS"
- Share Master Guide with applicants
- Budget: $50-75/hr for 96 hours

**Week 2-9**: Development

- You review/test each phase

**Cost**: $10-15K one-time, $160-700/month services
**Timeline**: 8-10 weeks
**Result**: Professional quality, less time investment

---

### Path C: Claude Code (Experimental)

**This Week**:

1. Copy Master Guide to Claude Code
2. Ask Claude Code to start Phase 1
3. Iterate and refine
4. Deploy via Lovable/Vercel

**Cost**: Claude subscription + services
**Timeline**: Unknown (new technology)
**Result**: Faster but requires debugging

## 🎯 CRITICAL: What Makes This Guide Different

### The 10 Original Documents Were...

- ❌ Duplicated (2 rebuild plans, 2 prompts libraries, 3 quick starts)
- ❌ Missing WasteWise business logic
- ❌ Generic SaaS templates, not tailored
- ❌ Didn't reference your SKILL files
- ❌ Inconsistent specifications

### The Master Guide Is...

- ✅ Single source of truth (no duplication)
- ✅ Includes ALL WasteWise business rules
- ✅ Tailored to waste management industry
- ✅ Integrated with SKILL\_\_2_UPDATED.md
- ✅ Consistent throughout

### Specifically, It Includes...

From **SKILL\_\_2_UPDATED.md**:

- Compactor optimization threshold: **<7 tons/haul** (not 5 or 6)
- Contamination threshold: **>3% of spend**
- Bulk subscription threshold: **>$500/month**
- Lease-up detection: **>40% below benchmark**
- Property benchmarks by type (Garden/Mid/High-rise)
- Validation framework (40+ checks)
- Regulatory research protocol (2 searches max)

From **wastewise_expense_format_template_UPDATED.md**:

- Row-based expense analysis format
- Monthly subtotals with cost per door
- Invoice number requirements
- Excel formatting standards

From **SKILL_MD_TOKEN_UPDATES.md**:

- Token budget management
- Ordinance database caching
- Efficient API usage

**Without these, the build would fail** to match your production quality.

## ✅ WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW

### Step 1: Review (30 minutes)

Read both documents I created:

1. **DOCUMENTATION_REVIEW_SUMMARY.md** first
   - Understand what was wrong
   - See how I fixed it
2. **WASTEWISE_LOVABLE_MASTER_GUIDE.md** second
   - Skim the structure
   - Focus on Phase 3 (business logic)
   - Verify calculations match your expectations

### Step 2: Verify Business Rules (30 minutes)

Check that these match your expectations:

- [ ] Compactor threshold is 7 tons/haul
- [ ] Contamination threshold is 3% of spend
- [ ] Bulk subscription threshold is $500/month
- [ ] Lease-up variance is 40% below benchmark
- [ ] Benchmarks correct for Garden/Mid/High-rise
- [ ] Branding is "WasteWise by THE Trash Hub"
- [ ] Contacts correct (Keith Conrad, Cole Myers)

If anything is wrong, let me know and I'll update.

### Step 3: Choose Your Path (Today)

Decide:

- [ ] DIY with Lovable (8 weeks, $0 labor)
- [ ] Hire developer (8-10 weeks, $10-15K)
- [ ] Try Claude Code (timeline TBD, experimental)

### Step 4: Set Up Accounts (1 hour)

Whichever path you choose, you'll need:

- [ ] Lovable account (lovable.dev)
- [ ] Supabase account (supabase.com)
- [ ] OpenAI account + API key
- [ ] Anthropic account + API key
- [ ] Brave Search API key

### Step 5: Start Building (This Week)

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### Before You Start Building

1. **Test Database Schema First**
   - Copy SQL from Master Guide
   - Create tables in Supabase
   - Test a few inserts
   - Verify RLS policies

2. **Get API Keys Early**
   - OpenAI: $5 minimum
   - Anthropic: $5 minimum
   - Brave Search: Free tier available
   - Test each API before integration

3. **Set Up Error Tracking**
   - Sentry (optional but helpful)
   - Monitor API costs
   - Track processing failures

### During Development

1. **Follow Phases in Order**
   - Don't skip ahead
   - Test thoroughly at each phase
   - Phase 3 is most critical (AI integration)

2. **Validate Calculations**
   - Compare to your Excel outputs
   - Test with real invoices
   - Verify thresholds trigger correctly

3. **Keep Master Guide Updated**
   - Add learnings as you go
   - Note what worked/didn't work
   - Share improvements with me

## 🚧 POTENTIAL CHALLENGES

### Challenge 1: PDF Parsing

**Issue**: Invoices have varying formats  
**Solution**:

- Start with common vendors (WM, Ally)
- Use GPT-4o with detailed prompts
- Allow manual corrections
- Build format library over time

### Challenge 2: API Costs

**Issue**: OpenAI/Anthropic can get expensive  
**Solution**:

- Use ordinance database (cache results)
- Limit searches to 2 max per property
- Batch OpenAI calls when possible
- Monitor spending daily

### Challenge 3: Regulatory Research

**Issue**: Ordinances hard to find  
**Solution**:

- Prioritize municode.com
- Accept lower confidence scores
- Build ordinance database over time
- Manual verification for important clients

### Challenge 4: Time Investment

**Issue**: 96 hours is a lot  
**Solution**:

- Start with 8-hour quick start (Phase 1-2)
- Get feedback from beta users
- Iterate based on real needs
- Consider hiring for Phase 3+
