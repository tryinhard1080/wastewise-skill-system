SKILL: waste-contract-extractor v2.1

=== WHAT'S NEW IN V2.1 ===

✅ Granular expense tracking (month/account/category)
✅ Transparent optimization calculations (4-section step-by-step)
✅ Investigation tracker for variance follow-up
✅ Vendor performance scorecards
✅ Quarterly budget impacts for Asset Business Plans

Based on real operational user feedback!

===========================

HOW TO USE:

"Hey Claude, I uploaded our waste contract and 7 months of invoices. I need:
 1. Granular expense tracking so I can investigate variances
 2. Transparent optimization calculations to defend savings to my CFO
 3. Quarterly budget impacts for our Asset Business Plan"

OPERATIONAL USER EXAMPLE (Property Manager - Trevor):

"I've uploaded our Waste Connections contract and invoices from Jan-Jul 2025. 
My boss keeps asking about expense spikes and I can't answer without digging 
through PDFs for 30 minutes. I also need to explain optimization savings to 
our CFO with math I can defend. Can you analyze this and give me:

- Month-by-month expense tracking by account number
- Auto-flagged variances (>20% changes)
- Step-by-step optimization calculations showing the savings math
- Implementation timeline with quarterly budget impacts for 2026 planning"

EXECUTIVE USER EXAMPLE (Regional Director):

"Analyze these contracts and invoices, focusing on optimization opportunities 
and contract risks. I need an executive summary for my VP and detailed 
operational analysis for my property managers."

PROCUREMENT EXAMPLE:

"We're negotiating a new contract. Can you analyze our current agreement and 
7 months of invoices to build a vendor performance scorecard and identify 
areas for cost reduction?"

===========================

BEST RESULTS:

Document Prep:
✅ Upload 6-12 months of invoices for trend analysis
✅ Include complete contract with all pages
✅ Name files: PropertyName_Vendor_Type_Date.pdf
✅ Ensure invoices show account numbers

What to Expect:
✅ Granular month/account/category expense tracking
✅ Auto-flagged variances (>20% change)
✅ Investigation tracker for follow-up
✅ Transparent, step-by-step optimization math
✅ Quarterly budget impacts aligned to fiscal calendar
✅ Vendor performance scorecard for negotiations

Key Features:
✅ Traceable to source invoices (every number cites Invoice #)
✅ Verifiable calculations (show every assumption)
✅ Investigation-friendly (flag + track + resolve)
✅ Budget-cycle aligned (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, 2026)

===========================

VALIDATION CHECKLIST:

After running the skill, verify:

□ Can you trace flagged variances to specific invoice numbers?
□ Can you explain optimization math to a non-technical stakeholder?
□ Do quarterly budget impacts align with your fiscal calendar?
□ Are account numbers consistent across all invoices?
□ Can you answer "Why did X change?" using Historical Expense Detail?

===========================

WHAT CHANGED FROM V2.0:

❌ REMOVED: Redundant summary tabs (2025 Summary, Monthly Analysis)
✅ ADDED: Investigation Tracker section
✅ ENHANCED: Historical Expense Detail (month/account/haul count/% change/flags)
✅ REDESIGNED: Optimization Analysis (4-section transparent calculations)
✅ ENHANCED: Implementation Roadmap (quarterly budget impacts)
✅ NEW SHEET: Vendor Performance (service quality metrics)
✅ NEW SHEET: Monitor Vendors (vendor shortlist)
✅ STREAMLINED: Single "Executive Overview" for leadership

===========================

OPERATIONAL FOCUS:

v2.1 prioritizes DETAIL over SUMMARIES because:

"When my boss asks 'Why did Account 0156898 have 5 hauls in May 
when average is 2?', I need granular data to answer in 2 minutes, 
not high-level summaries that require 30 minutes of PDF digging."

- Real feedback from property manager "Trevor"
